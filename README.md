# Breakout!

Breakout! is a simple game where the user moves their left/right arrow keys to bounce a ball to bricks that break upon being touched by a brick. This application was created by using CanvasAPI to draw the graphics. The goal of this project is to get practice using the CanvasAPI and taking advantage of JavaScript's forEach() method to loop through arrays to quickly draw or change graphics.
